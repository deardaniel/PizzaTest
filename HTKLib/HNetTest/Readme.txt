HNETTEST

This test loads a network and displays it using the graphical trace facility built-in to the ATK version of HNet.  Some sample files based on the "bitbut" network used in the HTK manual are provided as a demonstration.   Note that this graphical display can be produced for any system just by setting the trace flag "20" in HNet.

To run the test, invoke as

> HNetTest -C bitbut.cfg -H ../../Resources/UK_SI_ZMFCC/WI4 bitbut.dct bitbut.net ../../Resources/UK_SI_ZMFCC/hmmlist

alternatively if running in a unix or cygwin shell, just type 

> run.sh
